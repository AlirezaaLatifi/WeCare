## Lessons Learned

I used Sass and CSS Animation for the first time and also tried reinforcing layout-related skills such as Normal flow, Flexbox, Grid, and Positions.

It was awesome to use grid column with auto-fit and minmax functions to make layout responsive without using any media query! üòç
