## Lessons Learned

I used Sass and  CSS Animation for the first time and also tried reinforcing layout-related skills such as Normal flow, Flexbox, Grid, and Positions.

It was really awsome to use grid column with auto-fit  and minmax functions to make layout responsive without using any media query! üòç
