# Wecare 
It's a single responsive web page of a sample healthcare website's [design on the dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/16148550-Medical-Website-Landing-Page-Redesign/attachments/8003722?mode=media), developed for training purposes.

## I was focused on 

- Layout / Responsive Design
- Sass
- BEM
- CSS Animation


## Lessons Learned

I used Sass and CSS Animation for the first time and also tried to stick to BEM principles, and reinforcing layout-related skills such as Normal flow, Flexbox, Grid, and Positions.

It was awesome to use grid column with auto-fit and minmax functions to make layout responsive without using any media query! üòç
